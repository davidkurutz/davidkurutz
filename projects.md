### Xorro P2P
Inspired by BitTorrent, IPFS, and P2P Systems past and current, I set out to build one from scratch. 

Xorro P2P features a full implementation of a Kademlia distributed hash table in Ruby, an administrative web UI built in Sinatra, file sharding and re-assembly, and shard retrieval from multiple sources.
